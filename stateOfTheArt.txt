### State of the Art in Triple-Frequency Cycle Slip Detection and Correction Methods for GNSS

#### Introduction
Cycle slips in GNSS occur due to signal interruptions or high receiver dynamics, leading to sudden jumps in the carrier phase measurements. Detecting and correcting these slips is crucial for maintaining high-precision positioning. The advent of triple-frequency GNSS signals has introduced new opportunities and challenges in cycle slip detection and correction.

#### Classification of Methods
Cycle slip detection and correction methods can be classified based on the types of measurement combinations they use and whether these combinations are applied independently or in a cascading manner.

1. **Independent Measurements Combinations**:
   - **Constant Detection Threshold**: Methods using a fixed threshold for detection, often based on geometry-free, ionospheric-free, or code-phase combinations.
   - **Adaptive Detection Threshold**: Methods that adjust the detection threshold dynamically, typically incorporating statistical models or filtering techniques.

2. **Measurements Combinations in Cascade**:
   - These methods apply multiple combinations sequentially, enhancing the robustness of detection by progressively isolating errors through different combinations of measurements.

#### Independent Measurements Combinations with Constant Detection Threshold

In the paper "A Real-Time Cycle Slip Detection and Repair Method Based on Ionospheric Delay Prediction for Undifferenced Triple-Frequency BDS Signals" by Zhao et al., the method relies on geometry-free and ionospheric-free phase combinations. These combinations are designed to eliminate geometric and ionospheric errors, making the detection sensitive solely to cycle slips. This method uses a constant detection threshold, ensuring simplicity and computational efficiency. The primary advantage of this method is its real-time capability and effectiveness under varying ionospheric conditions. However, the constant threshold may limit its adaptability to rapidly changing environments or receiver dynamics【15:1†source】.

The study "A Triple-Frequency Cycle Slip Detection and Correction Method for GPS" by Zhang et al. introduces a method utilizing triple-frequency phase combinations, specifically Melbourne-Wübbena and ionospheric-free combinations. These combinations help minimize ionospheric and geometric influences. The method employs a fixed detection threshold, enhancing its reliability in stable conditions. Its significant advantage lies in its robustness against high ionospheric activity and multipath effects. However, the fixed threshold may not be optimal for all dynamic scenarios, potentially leading to missed detections or false positives【15:2†source】.

#### Independent Measurements Combinations with Adaptive Detection Threshold

In "GPS/BDS Triple-Frequency Cycle Slip Detection and Repair Based on Moving Window Global Search Method" by Feng et al., an algorithm is presented that uses phase measurements from all three frequencies with adaptive statistical tests and prediction models. This method adapts its detection threshold based on the statistical properties of the observed data, enhancing its sensitivity to cycle slips even in high-dynamic environments. The main advantage of this adaptive approach is its high detection reliability and real-time processing capability. However, the complexity of adaptive thresholding increases computational demands and requires continuous data quality monitoring【15:3†source】.

#### Measurements Combinations in Cascade

In "A Triple-Frequency Cycle Slip Detection and Correction Method Based on Modified HMW Combinations Applied on GPS and BDS" by Liu et al., a moving sliding window approach is employed, where phase measurements are continuously monitored using a sliding window that adapts based on data dynamics. This method cascades different phase combinations to detect both small and large cycle slips. The cascading approach provides robustness in long-duration observations, reducing the likelihood of missing slips. The main advantage is its adaptability to different data conditions, but it comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and potential delays in detection due to the sliding window mechanism【15:4†source】.

Finally, the paper "Real-Time Detection and Repair of Cycle Slips in Dual- and Triple-Frequency GNSS Observations" by Yang et al. presents a method integrating multiple detection techniques in a cascading manner, including phase and code combinations, ionospheric delay modeling, and quality control checks. This comprehensive approach ensures high accuracy and robustness by sequentially applying different detection strategies. The primary advantage is its effectiveness in challenging environments, providing reliable cycle slip detection and correction. However, the integration of multiple techniques can be computationally intensive and may require precise auxiliary data for optimal performance【15:5†source】.

#### Conclusion

The reviewed papers collectively highlight the advancements in triple-frequency cycle slip detection and correction methods. Techniques such as ionospheric delay prediction, Melbourne-Wübbena combinations, instantaneous detection algorithms, moving sliding window approaches, and integrated detection strategies demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and reliability. These methods address various challenges posed by dynamic environments and ionospheric disturbances, providing robust solutions for high-precision GNSS applications. The continuous development and integration of these techniques are essential for enhancing the performance and reliability of GNSS systems in diverse operational scenarios.
